## Introduction

This application is a **React + TypeScript + Vite** project designed for efficient and scalable development. It interacts with a backend API to manage **agents**, **customers**, and **orders**. The client is designed to ensure robust role-based access control (RBAC) and supports features like CRUD operations and data visualization.

The technologies used include:
- **React** for UI components.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **Vite** for fast development and bundling.
- **Material UI** for styling and prebuilt components.
- **Custom Hooks** for reusable logic.
- **Context API** for global state.

---

## Features

- **Role-Based UI**: Users only see what their role permits (Admin, Agent, Customer, Guest).
- **CRUD Functionality**: Add, edit, delete, and view agents, customers, and orders.
- **Pagination**: Efficiently handle large datasets with Material UI's Pagination.
- **Data Summarization**: Visual summaries of total orders by customer, agent, and country.
- **Reusable Components**: Custom hooks, context providers, and components for modularity.

## Why These Choices?

### 1. **React + TypeScript**
   - Ensures a type-safe, scalable, and maintainable codebase.
   - TypeScript reduces runtime errors and provides better developer tooling.

### 2. **Vite**
   - Provides fast startup and HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for an optimized development experience.

### 3. **Material UI**
   - Offers a consistent, modern UI with ready-to-use components.
   - Simplifies layout and design while allowing customization.

### 4. **Centralized State Management with Contexts**
   - Separate contexts (e.g., `AuthContext`, `CustomerContext`) ensure a modular and testable global state.
   - Centralized management avoids prop drilling and improves maintainability.

### 5. **Custom Hooks**
   - Encapsulates reusable logic, such as API calls or authentication, keeping components clean and focused.
   - Example: `useCustomers` for fetching and managing customer data.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Resquared/re2-frontend-challenge-pebueno
npm install
cd client
npm install
```
#### 2. Create a `.env` File Add the following environment variable to your `.env` file:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
```
#### 3. Run the Development Server Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
#### 4. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
